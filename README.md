## 📁 Repository Overview

This project is organized into the following main folders:

### 🔹 **Classification**
Contains projects and notebooks where ML models are applied to **classification problems**, such as predicting classes or categories based on input features (e.g., K-NN classification)

### 🔹 **Regression**
Contains projects and notebooks demonstrating **regression models**, where the goal is to predict continuous numerical values (e.g., salary prediction, linear/polynomial regression)

Each folder includes Jupyter Notebooks with:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Interpretation of performance
